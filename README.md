# CIS700-project

We used Pointer Network to do three different tasks. Three tasks are finding unique elements in a given list, finding all endpoints in a sequence and set operations. Pointer Network demonstrated an excellent performance in finding all endpoints while it seems worked not well in finding unique elements and set operations. In the results part, pointer networks with larger weight size or layer size have relatively better performance. It indicates that there is a positive correlation between such two configurations and networks’ learning efficiency. However it also seems to have some upper bound for learning efficiency shown in Jiaming’s cases. 

For "Finding unique element" task(Borui):
1. All the necessary code is under the same directory Finding unique elements(Borui He)/. Do not use any file under parent directory instead.
2. Download ZIP file and unzip the directory Finding unique elements(Borui He)/ to your desktop.
3. Open the "main.py" file and run it.
4. Dependencies: Numpy version 1.18.1, Pytorch version 1.5.0 and matplotlib version 3.1.3.
